# RoadToDynamicLinq
We all love LINQ in C#. Fosna will talk about advanced LINQ concepts like expression trees, how to build them, how to parse them, how to exploit them. We'll review what we learned in first meetup and show few demos. If you're interested in this kind of crazy stuff come and join our meetup.  Notes from last meetup are available at http://www.axilis.com/giving-back/#meetups.
